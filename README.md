# SVD-vs-CUR

This project highlights a detailed comparison between the two matrix factorization methods namely SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and CUR Matrix Approximation, developed in partial fulfilment for the Information Retrieval Course offered at my University.

### Instructions:

### Executing the files

#### For Singular Value Decomposition
* Execute the python file 'svd.py'.
* The data set used is [jester-data-3] (http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/).

#### For CUR Matrix Approximation
* Execute the python file 'cur.py'.
* The data set used is [jester-data-3] (http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/).

#### For Experimental Comparison and Related graphs between CUR and SVD
* Execute the python file 'svdcurcomparison.py'.

### Please read the file [Design_Document.pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzNf9u6dqAlhb295U1YtUEQxN2c) for complete understanding of the project.
